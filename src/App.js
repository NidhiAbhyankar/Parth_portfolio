            I am a data enthusiast who likes to dig into large datasets to find
            patterns and meaningful insights, that help drive impactful
            decisions. As a masterâ€™s student, at NC State in the Department of
            Industrial engineering, I have acquired skills in SQL, Python,
            Tableau. I like working on challenging projects and enjoy being a
            part of a team. I look forward to applying the skills I have learned
            in the industry.
